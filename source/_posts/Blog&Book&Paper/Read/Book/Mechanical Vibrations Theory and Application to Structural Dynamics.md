Mechanical Vibrations Theory and Application to Structural Dynamics (Michel Geradin, Daniel J. Rixen) 

<!-- more -->

Chapter Structure: 
- analytical dynamics of discrete systems
- the undamped vibrations of n-degree-of-freedom systems and begins by introducing the concepts of equilibrium position and of equilibrium configuration corresponding to steady motion
- the damped oscillations of n-degree-of-freedom systems
- the analysis of continuous systems
- the approximation problem for continuous systems is investigated by means of displacement methods
- deals with solution methods for the eigenvalue problem
- some aspects of direct methods for integrating the transient dynamic response
