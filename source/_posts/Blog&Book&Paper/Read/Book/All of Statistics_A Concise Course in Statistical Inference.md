“The basic problem that we study in probability is: Given a data generating process, what are the properties of the outcomes?” ([Wasserman, pp. -](zotero://select/library/items/8RZFAYJA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5PN23CQL?page=6&annotation=TT7HT86A))

“The basic problem of statistical inference is the inverse of probability: Given the outcomes, what can we say about the process that generated the data?” ([Wasserman, pp. -](zotero://select/library/items/8RZFAYJA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5PN23CQL?page=6&annotation=64C3KX9C))
